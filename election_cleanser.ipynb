    "Cleanser for the data in the elections demo.  Takes in elections.csv, a spreadsheet with states in the rows and years in the columns.  A group of columns represents a year, and a column the votes for a candidate in the year.  There is a total for each year as well, so the minimum is 3: (republicam, democrat, total) First row is year numbers.  Second is candidate name and party, separated by a dash.  3-54 is votes.  First column is states, and first state is Nationwide.  We will output a flat table, with columns (Year, Candidate, Party, State, Vote, Pct).\n",
